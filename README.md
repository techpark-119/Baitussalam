# Assalamualaikum To All Students and Developers. I Hope Everyone is Good!
### This Repository is made specially for the help of Baitussalam PSDC students and Other Innovative Learners and it is also my Current Repository.(As of 26 Feb 2025) 
# What is the purpose of creating and modifying this Repository for a very long period of time?
The Answer is very simple, instead of getting left to right to gather the information around the internet and having to constantly seeking and learning new things that are outside of your knowledge zone and not only learning from too much other sources for individual concepts but also relying on their information can lead to extreme frustation and time consuming. That's why this masterpiece come in handy!

It combines everything into into one piece and set of information in this repository so you don't have to miss out on anything! It also facilitates multiple sources for concepts so if you don't understand any concept from one source in this Repository, other sources within this same Repository are also an option for you. 
It also ensures that new concepts, terms, and updates of JavaScript Programming is in your reach by adding them, thus keeping you up-to-date.

## Contents Included In This Repository:

1. Linux, HTML, Git, and CSS slides (just slides for these courses, as this Repository is mainly focused on JavaScript).
2. JavaScript Contents which includes:
  * Assignments given to Students to do within the class (In-Class Assignments).
  * Assignments given to Students to do before the next class or specific deadlines (Post-Class Assignments).
  * Audio of Class Lectures (Compromised due to file size,sound echo,noise,etc).
  * Lecture Codes and Programs taught during the class by Teacher that was also in his Repository. 
  * Slides(PDFs) of All the JavaScript Classes.
  * Other PSDC students's Repostitories and Programs for helping purposes.
  * My own working and testing Code during the Class.
  * And Other Contents.

## Some Terms that I defined in this Repository:
 * For each content group, there is a seperate HTML file for it.
 * In the "Post-Class" and "In-Class" Assignments folder, numbers(1,2,3,etc) are used to represent Class numbers in respect of slides Numbers.(e.g.: In-Class 1 represents given assignments of Slide 1 sucessfully done within the class).
 * Also in these both folder mentioned above, "A" represents the Text file mentioning the assignmets given within or after the class(InClass or PostClass), whereas "B" represents the JavaScript file that contains the completed code of the given assigment.(e.g.: PostClass-1a represents for the text file of slide 01 mentioning the given assignment after the class).
 * Both in the InClass and PostClass assignments folder, Text and JavaScript files are paired to each other for ease.
 * "##" represents main heading and "#" represents sub-heading.
 * Next to ##, there is a number in round brackets that specifies the page no. of slides where the assignment is actually located.
 * "------" horizontal line represents the start of next exercise of the same concept after one, whereas "_____" represents that the next exercise is from the different concept.
 * Audio files inside the "Audio" folder are the recorded files of class lectures. Each class session audio is splitted into three parts (1),(2), and (3) respectively, otherwise it will exceed 100 MB and can't be published due to Github publish limit of 100 MB. That's why I said compromised above. Also, three parts of audio combined together represents one entire slide. e.g.: 01-01-2025 is slide 05 audio or can be called as "lecture audio"
 * Important files of other developers from their Repositories are also present and located in the "Outsiders" folder.
 * And finally, last but not the least, my own working and testing code during or after the class is also included and located in the "Work" folder.
