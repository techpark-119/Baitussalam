# Assalamualaikum To All Students and Developers. I Hope Everyone is Good!
### This Repository is made specially for the help of Baitussalam PSDC students and Other Innovative Learners and it is also my Current Repository.(As of 26 Feb 2025) 
# What is the purpose of creating and modifying this Repository for a very long period of time?
The Answer is very simple, instead of getting left to right to gather the information around the internet and having to constantly seeking and learning new things that are outside of your knowledge zone and not only learning from too much other sources for individual concepts but also relying on their information can lead to extreme frustation and time consuming. That's why this masterpiece come in handy!

It combines everything into into one piece and set of information in this repository so you don't have to miss out on anything! It also facilitates multiple sources for concepts so if you don't understand any concept from one source in this Repository, other sources within this same Repository are also an option for you. 
It also ensures that new concepts, terms, and updates of JavaScript Programming is in your reach by adding them, thus keeping you up-to-date.
